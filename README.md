# Password Predictor
## Some background info:
In 2021 during covid I was an IT student and looking for some fun. I decided to set up a ssh honeypot and see what kind of passwords hackers where trying on it.
Al this data can be found in [SSH-findings](https://github.com/anakwaboe4/SSH-findings) project. I copied over the main events.csv file to this project to use as a dataset.
## Goal of this project:
This project is a very simple case of classification. The goal is to predict the if a given string would be in the list of passwords tried on my ssh honeypot.
